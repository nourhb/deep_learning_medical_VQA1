\chapter*{General Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{General Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become essential tools in many fields, especially in healthcare. These technologies allow computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions with high accuracy. One of the most exciting applications of AI is Visual Question Answering (VQA) , where a system can understand both images and natural language to give meaningful answers to questions about visual content.

In recent years, VQA has shown great potential in various domains, including education, robotics, and medicine. In healthcare, VQA systems can help doctors analyze medical images like X-rays, MRI scans, and endoscopic videos. They can answer questions such as "Is there a tumor in this image?" or "What is the size of the lesion?" This helps improve diagnosis speed and accuracy, especially in areas with limited access to expert doctors.

This project focuses on developing a mobile application that uses VQA to assist in diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases using endoscopic images and medical questions. The system combines two powerful models: MobileNetV2 for image processing and BioClinical-BERT for understanding medical questions. The app is built using Flutter for the frontend, and Firebase is used for user authentication and data storage. The AI model is trained using the Kvasir-VQA dataset and deployed via Hugging Face Spaces .

This report presents the full development process of the project. It is organized into three main chapters:

Chapter 01: Introduction
This chapter gives an overview of VQA and its importance in healthcare. It explains the background of the project, the use of VQA in medicine, the problem being addressed, and the motivation behind building such a system.
Chapter 02: UML Design and System Architecture
This chapter describes the design of the system using UML diagrams such as use case, class, and sequence diagrams. It also explains the overall architecture, including how the AI model, backend, and mobile app work together.
Chapter 03: Realization
This chapter covers the implementation of the project. It includes details about the frontend interface built with Flutter, the dataset used, the Firebase backend, the training and testing of the AI model, and how it was deployed online.
This project aims to show how modern AI techniques can be integrated into real-world applications, especially in the healthcare field.

\chapter{Chapter 01: Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses, optimizing hospital workflows, and personalizing patient care. According to recent studies, AI-powered tools have reduced diagnostic errors by up to 30\% in radiology and pathology. Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a cutting-edge application of AI that combines computer vision and natural language processing to answer questions about images. This project focuses on developing a mobile application that uses VQA to assist in diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases using endoscopic images and medical questions.

\section{Motivation: Real-World Impact}
In many regions, access to expert gastroenterologists is limited. By providing an AI-powered assistant, MedGastro can help bridge this gap, offering reliable support to both clinicians and patients.

\section{History of VQA in Medicine}
The first VQA systems in medicine appeared in 2017, focusing on simple radiology questions. Since then, datasets like VQA-RAD and Med-VQA have enabled more complex, clinically relevant applications.

\section{Application of VQA in healthcare field}
Visual Question Answering has found promising applications in the medical field, particularly in assisting clinicians with diagnostic tasks using medical imaging. Early efforts explored VQA systems to answer basic questions about radiology images, such as "Is there a fracture visible?" or "What is the size of the tumor?". More recently, specialized datasets like Med-VQA and PathVQA have been developed to support question-answering systems tailored for radiology reports, histopathological images, and clinical decision-making.

\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}
\textbf{\textit{Problem Statement:}} \\
In the medical field, accurate and fast diagnosis is crucial for early detection of gastrointestinal diseases such as polyps, ulcers, or tumors. However, manual interpretation of endoscopic images by human experts can be time-consuming and subject to errors due to fatigue or lack of experience. While deep learning models have shown great performance in image classification and natural language understanding, deploying these models into a real-world mobile application that supports clinical decision-making remains a challenge. The need for an automated, intelligent system that combines both visual and textual information is clear.

Our goal is to develop a mobile application that integrates a trained multimodal AI model (MobileNetV2 for images + BioClinical-BERT for medical questions) to:

    
- Take an endoscopic image
    
- Accept a medical question about the image
    
- Return a diagnostic answer (e.g., ``polyp'', ``inflammation'')

This project focuses on bridging the gap between AI research and practical deployment in healthcare using Flutter and Flask.

\textbf{\textit{Motivation:}} \\
The motivation behind this project stems from several key factors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Need}: Endoscopic exams generate large volumes of data daily. A system that provides quick and reliable analysis helps reduce misdiagnosis and speeds up patient care.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility via Mobile Apps}: By integrating the model into a Flutter-based mobile app, we make the power of AI accessible to doctors and patients anywhere, anytime.
    \item \textbf{Efficiency and Speed}: Using a lightweight architecture allows our solution to run efficiently even on devices with limited computing power like mobile phones or low-end laptops.
    \item \textbf{Educational Purpose}: This project serves as a practical example of how modern AI techniques can be applied to real-world problems, especially in healthcare.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, this chapter provided an overview of AI , machine learning , and VQA , with a focus on their growing role in healthcare. It explained the motivation behind building a mobile application that uses AI to answer medical questions based on endoscopic images. The chapter also introduced the structure of the report, showing what each next chapter will cover.

\chapter{Chapter 02: UML Design and System Architecture}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter explains how the MedGastro application was designed. It shows the different parts of the system and how they work together. The chapter begins with an overview of the system and then uses UML diagrams to describe the structure and behavior of the application. These diagrams include use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams, which help explain how users interact with the app and how data moves between different parts of the system. This chapter gives a clear picture of the overall design before moving on to the implementation details in the next chapter.

\section{Detailed Explanation of the Use Case Diagram}
The use case diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:use-case}) illustrates the interactions between different user types and the system. For example, the 'Analyze Image' use case is central to the application's value proposition, allowing users to upload images and receive diagnostic answers.

\section{Design Rationale}
We chose a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Each component (frontend, backend, AI model) can be updated independently, facilitating future improvements.

\section{Class Diagram}
\begin{figure}{H}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ClassDiagram1.jpg}
    \caption{Class diagram}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

The Class Diagram shows the structure of the MedGastro application and how its different parts work together. It includes classes like User , System , Profile , Analyze , History , and AI Model , which are connected to support features such as user authentication, image analysis, and system management. The User can sign up, log in, and ask medical questions about endoscopic images. The System coordinates all interactions, while the AI Model processes the images and generates answers. Users are linked to their Profile and History , allowing them to manage personal data and review past analyses. The System Manager has control over administrative tasks. This diagram gives a clear view of how the app is organized and how data flows between components to deliver a functional and intelligent healthcare tool. 

\section{Sequence Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{SequenceDiagram.png}
    \caption{Sequence diagram}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

The Sequence Diagram shows how different parts of the MedGastro application work together when users interact with the system. It includes components like the User , the System , the AI Model , the Database , and the Manager . The diagram explains step-by-step interactions for actions like signing up, logging in, resetting passwords, analyzing images, and managing user profiles. When a user uploads an image and asks a question, the system sends the data to the AI model for analysis and stores the results in the database. The manager can also perform administrative tasks after logging in. This diagram gives a clear view of how information flows between users and the app's components, ensuring smooth and secure operation. 

\section{Architecture Overview}
The system is built using a multimodal architecture that combines both image analysis and natural language understanding to answer medical questions based on endoscopic images. The core of the model includes two main components: a vision module and a language module.

For the vision part, we use MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network, to extract features from endoscopic images. MobileNetV2 is chosen for its ability to process images with high accuracy while keeping computational costs low, which is important for real-world deployment.

On the language side, we use BioClinical-BERT, a pre-trained language model designed for medical text understanding. This helps the system interpret medical questions accurately and relate them to visual content in the image.

These two modules ,the vision model (MobileNetV2) and the language model (BioClinical-BERT)  are combined using a fusion layer that integrates both visual and textual features. A final classification layer then predicts the answer based on this combined input. The model was trained in Jupyter Notebook, saved as a .pth file, and integrated into an API using Flask Finally, the model was connected to a mobile application built with Flutter, allowing users to upload medical images and ask diagnostic questions directly from their smartphones.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, the design of the MedGastro application was presented using UML diagrams and a detailed description of the system architecture. The use case, class, and sequence diagrams helped show how users interact with the app and how the different components communicate. This design forms the foundation for building the actual application and ensures that all parts of the system work together efficiently. With the design phase completed, the next chapter will focus on implementing the system, including the frontend interface, backend services, and AI model integration.

\section{Frontend}
The frontend of the application was developed using Flutter, a modern cross-platform framework created by Google, along with the Dart programming language. Flutter was chosen for its ability to deliver high-performance mobile applications with a native-like feel on both Android and iOS platforms from a single codebase. The user interface was designed and implemented using Android Studio, which provides a powerful environment for building, debugging, and testing Flutter applications. This combination allows for rapid development, hot-reload functionality, and a highly customizable UI through rich built-in widgets. The decision to use Flutter was driven by its excellent performance, expressive UI capabilities, strong community support, and seamless integration with backend services such as Firebase and external APIs. These features make it an ideal choice for building a responsive, scalable, and visually engaging mobile interface tailored to the needs of a healthcare-oriented Visual Question Answering system.

\section{Backend}
\subsection{Firebase}
Firebase is used in this project as the main backend service. It helps manage user accounts through authentication, store user data and history using Firestore, and save images with Cloud Storage. Firebase is chosen because it is fast to set up, easy to use, and works well with mobile apps. It also allows real-time updates, meaning users can see their data right after they add it. These features make Firebase a good choice for building a secure and efficient healthcare application like MedGastro.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Authentication.png}
    \caption{Authentication}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

In this project, Firebase Authentication is used to manage user accounts securely. It allows users to sign up and log in with an email and password. Firebase stores user credentials safely and checks them during login to make sure only the right user can access the account.

Each user gets a unique ID that helps keep their data private. This ID is used to link their information  like medical history and uploaded images to their account only.

Firebase also offers a password reset option. If a user forgets their password, they can receive a secure link by email to set a new one.

All of this happens automatically and safely, making it easy to build a secure healthcare app where user data stays protected.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Firestore.png}
    \caption{Firestore}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

In this project, Firebase Firestore is used to store and manage user data in a secure and organized way. It works like a database that keeps track of important information such as:

User profiles (name, email, date of birth, etc.)
Medical questions asked by users
AI-generated answers
Image upload history
Each user's analysis results over time
Firestore makes it easy to save, update, and retrieve this data in real time. This means when a user uploads an image or asks a question, the app can quickly store that information and show it back whenever needed.

In short, Firebase Firestore plays a key role in organizing and protecting user data, making the MedGastro app both functional and secure.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{storage.png}
    \caption{Storage}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

In this project, Firebase Storage is used to store medical images uploaded by users, such as endoscopic photos. It keeps these files safe in the cloud and makes them easy to access when needed for analysis.

Only logged-in users can upload or view their own images, which helps protect privacy. The system organizes files clearly so the app can find and use them quickly. Firebase Storage also grows automatically as more users join, without needing extra setup.

Thanks to Firebase Storage, the app can securely manage image data, support fast processing by the AI model, and offer a smooth experience for users

\subsection{AI Model}
The AI model developed in this project is designed to answer medical questions based on endoscopic images using Visual Question Answering (VQA) . It combines two types of deep learning models: one for analyzing images and another for understanding medical questions.

\textbf{Data Cleaning}
The dataset used is called Kvasir-VQA , which contains over 58,000 annotated endoscopic images.

*Before training, the data was cleaned:

-Text was converted to lowercase.

-Special characters were removed.

*A CSV file was created to store the cleaned image IDs, questions, and answers.

*Images were resized and normalized to be compatible with the vision model.

\textbf{Models Used:}

1-MobileNetV2 :

-Used for image analysis.

-It's a lightweight and fast convolutional neural network that works well on mobile devices.

-It extracts visual features from endoscopic images.

2-BioClinical-BERT :

-Used for question understanding.

-This is a pre-trained language model fine-tuned for medical text.

-It helps the system understand what the user is asking about an image.

These two models are combined into a multimodal architecture , meaning they work together to process both the image and the question and give a meaningful answer.

\textbf{Sample Size:}

*A subset of the full dataset was used for faster training.

*The training was done on 7,000 samples , split into:

-80% for training

-10% for validation

-10% for testing

\textbf{Training Process:}

-The model was trained for 5 epochs (one full pass through the training data).

-During training, the model learned to combine image and question inputs and predict correct medical answers.

-Techniques like data augmentation , learning rate scheduling , and mixed precision training were used to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

\textbf{Results:}

-Training Accuracy : Reached 79.5%

-Validation Accuracy : Reached 80.29%

-Test Accuracy : Improved further to 83.29%

-Other metrics like precision and F1-score also showed good performance, reaching around 77.25% and 79.40% , respectively.

\textbf{Deployment Ready:}

-After training, the model was saved as a .pth file.

-It can now be integrated into the MedGastro mobile app via an API for real-world use.


\subsection{Deployment}
In this project, the trained AI model is connected to the mobile app using a Flask API . After training the model (MobileNetV2 + BioClinical-BERT), it was saved and deployed as a web service using Flask, which allows the app to send data (like images and questions) and receive predictions from the model. The Flutter-based mobile app communicates with this API over the internet, making it possible for users to get real-time answers about medical images directly on their phones. Using Flask made it easy to set up a simple server that handles requests from the app and returns results from the AI model in a fast and reliable way.
